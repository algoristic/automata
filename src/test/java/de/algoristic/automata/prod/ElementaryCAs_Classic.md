## The beauty of cellular automata
One of the questions that drove the invention of cellular automata was "What is the most simple set of rules that can lead to true complexity?"

The cellular automata proposed by Stephen Wolfram answer this question in an astonishing manner. Not only because some of the rules he found have been proven Turing complete - when visually applied, some rules are of ravishing beauty.
