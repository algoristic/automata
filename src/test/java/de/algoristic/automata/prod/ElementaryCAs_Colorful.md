# Classic Cellular Automata - Chaotic/Simple
These are the 256 elementary cellular automata proposed by Stephen Wolfram. They are computed with a random initial configuration of 101 cells over 101 generations.

These are the 256 elementary cellular automata proposed by Stephen Wolfram. They are computed with a single living cell as their initial configuration and live over 101 generations.

Living cells are colored in `#264653`, `#2A9D8F`, `#E9C46A`, `#F4A261` and `#EE6C4D`, dead cells and canvas in `#000000`.

## The beauty of cellular automata
One of the questions that drove the invention of cellular automata was "What is the most simple set of rules that can lead to true complexity?"

The cellular automata proposed by Stephen Wolfram answer this question in an astonishing manner. Not only because some of the rules he found have been proven Turing complete - when visually applied, some rules are of ravishing beauty.
